PointNet++ models originally sourced from https://github.com/erikwijmans/Pointnet2_PyTorch.

The specific files used were before commit erikwijmans/Pointnet2_PyTorch@22e8cf5 .

The _ext.*.so may need to be rebuilt depending on the machine specs being used. Please go to code directory and run:

> python3 models.py

If it prints "torch.Size([7, 10])", everything is working.

If it has a cuda error, try these steps:

1. Delete _ext.*.so
2. Go to the rebuild folder
2. Run >python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
3. Move the newly generated _ext file, from the rebuild/pointnet2 folder, to where the previous one was located
